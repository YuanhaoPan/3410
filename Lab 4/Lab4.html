<li>How to snowboarding?</li>
<p>Get on your snowboard. Secure your lead foot in place, but leave your back foot free for now. Once your lead foot is securely bound to your board, put on your snowboard leash to keep your snowboard from escaping down a hill when you step out of it. Leashes come in varying lengths; the most common type is long enough to strap below your knee. Although the leash should be among least of your concerns - before even considering using a lift a series of exercises with one foot strapped in should be done.Secure the leash to your snowboard, if it's not already integrated into the binding.
Wrap the leash around your lower leg and secure it snugly. For short wire leashes, attach the other end to your boot lace instead.
Be sure your leash is clearly visible. Many resorts won't allow you to snowboard without a visible leash.
Strap up. Go to the edge of the hill and sit down with your board perpendicular to the slope. This makes your board act as “brake” to keep you from sliding.
Put your rear boot into its binding. Make sure the bindings are snug and secure.
If you can move your foot while in the binding, or pull your heel up from the base, it's too loose.
Double check your lead foot and leash, and ensure they're secure as well.
Head downhill. Now that you're strapped in, you're ready to ride. Stand up and don't turn your snowboard so that the lead end of the board is pointing down the hill. Learn to slip down the fall line sideways first. Once you can control the speed and stop - sit down, roll over and learn to control the speed and stop on the front edge.
To move to the side, shift some of your body weight to one of your feet, use that foot as a pedal to turn more or less downhill. Learn to control your movement direction while keeping most of your weight on that foot.
Keep your knees slightly bent and your back straight to maintain balance as you gather speed.
Practice garlands. It's important to know how to control your speed, and turning is the only way to do this while you're on the slope. Garland is a turn without the edge change. When you can do garlands on both front and back edges - you might ask someone to assist you when trying your first full turn with an edge change. If you will proceed to full turns with an edge change without practicing garlands, you might end up with an incorrect technique ("sweeping with back foot") as displayed in the image above. That will stop you from progressing in the future, and fixing incorrect technique might take up to 10 times longer than learning from scratch.
Lean your body into the side of the slope to put weight on one edge of your snowboard. The edge your feet are pointing towards is the “toe edge;” the edge behind them is the “heel edge.”
Try both heel and toe edge garlands. You have to be able to do both with a very similar radius. Make sure to control your garland with weight shift (and fine tune with your front foot, using it as "pedal"). It is a good idea to have most of your body weight on a front foot (lean forward) when the board is headed down the fall line. The biggest mistake of all beginners is keeping body weight on back foot. In such case leaning onto heel/toe edge does not make the board turn properly, as if your weight was on both feet. Trying to keep most of your weight on a front foot while heading down the fall line will ensure that your weight is not on your back foot, and after some time it will feel very natural to keep your weight on both feet at all times.
Use weight shift to control your garlands and turns. While some schools teach to help yourself with shoulder rotation, this method might cover your mistakes, but not fix them. Maintain a straight back and bent knees as you do this, for safety reasons.</p>
