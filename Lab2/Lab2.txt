	In this class, I want to learn how does internet work and how those code work perfectly in order to let people to understand. I also want to create a website by myself at the end of this quarter.
	I found a interesting website, which is called slither.io. It is a online game website, the game is that you can create your own character as a snake, you can change the color and the figure of the snake. Once you finish editing, you can enter the game, which you need to eat the little light point in order to increase the length of your snake. If you hit someone else, you are going to die and other snakes can eat you to increase themselves, which means that if other snakes hit you, you can eat them to become more longer.
	I would like to create a website which is similar with the slither.io because I think this kind of website is really interesting. I believe what I learn in this class can help me build a good foundation about getting understand about how website work, and probably help me create my own website in the future.
